# These are aliases for material/databyte pairs which can be used
# in material sets. A material/databyte pair is normally
# ID/DATA but if the data is omitted, 0 is assumed for the databyte.
#
# In using an alias, it's possible to override the provided databyte.
# For example, given the list below, "clay" normally means stained_clay/0,
# but "clay/4" will map to stained_clay/4.

# These lists define the material sets to be used for each biome.
# Each new building in that biome will then use a random member
# of the list as its material set. Biome names here must be full
# names. If a biome is not named here, first a match will be looked
# for in the "matmatch" lists. If one is not found, the default will
# be used (a default must be provided).
#    
matlist:
    default:
        - mats.default
    desert:
        - mats.sand
    hell:
        - mats.nether

# These lists define material sets for those biomes not in the matlist
# above. The keys are regular expressions, but "*" is replaced with ".*"
# because of YAML not permitting "." inside a key.
#
# This list is only used if the biome is not present, by its full name,
# in the matlist. If it is also not found here, the default entry in the
# matlist is used.

matmatch:
    "*taiga*":
        - mats.taiga
    "frozen*":
        - mats.taiga
    "ice*":
        - mats.taiga    

# These are the material sets which are referred to by the lists above.
# Each entry within a set is used for a particular type of block inside
# the castle:
#
# primary -     used for most of the building
# secondary -   used for a bit of variety in Turtle building (columns,
#               roof crenellation), but also to underfill floating
#               buildings and for garden patterning.
# supsecondary- a loose building material which is subject to gravity,
#               like sand or gravel. Used in crenellation.
# ornament -    used for decorative blocks
# stair -       for stair exits
# fence -       for roof and interior fencing
# roofsteps -   for constructing pitched roofs
# ground -      for gardens and paths (and roof gardens).
# pole -        for some columns and parts of columns
# window -      for windows. If this is thin_glass, the window may
#               become a patterned stained-glass window.
#
# Each entry is a hash of material/data pairs, such as those used
# in the aliases, or an alias. The values are weights used in the
# selection. Whenever a new material manager is created, at the start
# of a new building, a new set of materials is created by weighted
# random selection from the entries.
#
# Inheritance
#
# It is possible for one material set to inherit any lists it doesn't
# explicitly specify from another, either using YAML's merge facility
# or by setting a base: key to the name of another material set,
# e.g. "base: mats.cobble".
# All sets inherit the set called "default".
