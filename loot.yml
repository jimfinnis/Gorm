# These are the various loot types. Material/data pairs
# are used as in biomes.yml, so aliases can be used too. The data
# value here is ignored, however.
#

# this is a list included in the main lists, keyed by mat/data pair
# with the chance as the value. This value is multiplied by the
# chance associated with the list when it is included
