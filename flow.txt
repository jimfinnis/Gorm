Within a building:
    Building constructor: 
        get type
        read config to build dimension data and get initial extent
    build:
        follow processing instructions:
            box - build box
            clear (mutex with above) - just fill with air
            makerooms - construct rooms
                parameter: rooms: weighted lists of room types for each grade
            singleroom (mutex with above) - make it one BlankRoom
            underfill
                parameter: underfill: % chance of solid
            roof
            garden
            farm
            floorlights
            outside - singleroom MUST have run
